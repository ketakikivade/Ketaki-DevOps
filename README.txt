Scenario 1 :

I have added 2 ways to generate random numbers through CLI using Python and Shell Script

===================PYTHON-PROGRAM On LINUX===========================

Steps to Run the python program on Linux:

1. Login to the Linux server through putty/tectia or tool you are using to login to the linux instances Or through the Linux terminal:

2. Enter the Host Name, User Name and Password 

3. Clone the GitHub repo using the below command:

  git clone https://github.com/ketakikivade/Ketaki-DevOps.git

4. RandomGenerator.py file will be downloaded in your server.

5. To execute the file use the below command:

python RandomGenerator.py OR python3 RandomGenerator.py (if python3 is installed you can check this by using command: which python)

6. Random numbers between 1-10 will be gerenrated every time you execute the program.


===================PYTHON-PROGRAM On MacOS===========================

Steps to Run the python program on Linux:

1. Open Launchpad

2. Search for Terminal

3. Type Python in the Terminal and you will able to see the version of Python installed.

4. Clone the GitHub repo using the below command:

  git clone https://github.com/ketakikivade/Ketaki-DevOps.git

5. RandomGenerator.py file will be downloaded in your server.

6. To execute the file use the below command:

python RandomGenerator.py OR python3 RandomGenerator.py (if python3 is installed you can check this by using command: which python)

7. Random numbers between 1-10 will be gerenrated every time you execute the program.
 

=====================SHELL-SCRIPT on Linux====================================

To execute Shell Script on Linux server:

1. Login to the Linux server through putty/tectia or tool you are using to login to the linux instances Or through linux terminal:

2. Enter the Host Name, User Name and Password 

3. Clone the GitHub repo using the below command:

git clone https://github.com/ketakikivade/Ketaki-DevOps.git

4. RandomGenerator.sh file will be downloaded in your server.

5. To execute the file use the below command on Linux use below command

./RandomGenerator.sh OR sh RandomGeneartor.sh

6. Random numbers between 1-10 will be gerenrated every time you execute the program.


=====================SHELL-SCRIPT on MacOS====================================

To execute Linux script on MacOS :

1. Open Launchpad

2. Search for Terminal

3. Clone the GitHub repo using the below command:

  git clone https://github.com/ketakikivade/Ketaki-DevOps.git

4. RandomGenerator.sh file will be downloaded in your server.

5. To execute the file use the below command:

sh RandomGenerator.sh OR ./RandomGenerator.sh

6. Random numbers between 1-10 will be gerenrated every time you execute the program.
